# Creating smart contracts and decentralized applications

## Business model

### Description

The project is a smart contract for a rent agreement, coded using Solidity. The contract is between three entities - a landlord, a tenant, and a property manager.
The contract tracks the beginning and end of the lease, and allows these entities to sign a contract, for the tenant to pay rent, and for the landlord and property manager to withdraw these funds. It also has the tenant pay a deposit upon signing a contract and allows the landlord to give it back or claim some of it for property damages.
